# Climate Hazards Data Integration and Visualization for the Climate Adaptation Solutions Accelerator (CASA) through School-Community Hubs

The CASAschools Github Organization was created to host code to be submitted with partial satisfaction of the [Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS)](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) Capstone Degree requirements for the [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, University of California, Santa Barbara](https://bren.ucsb.edu/)

The CASAschools team consists of: 

Faculty Advisor: Dr. Simone Pulver

Clients: Dr. Sarah Anderson & Dr. Danielle Harlow

Students: [Liane Chen](https://github.com/lchenhub), [Charlie Curtin](https://github.com/charliecurtin1), [Kristina Glass](https://github.com/kristinaglass), and [Hazel Vaquero](https://github.com/hazelvaq).

## Project Summary

Community engagement in planning is essential for effective and just climate adaptation. Unfortunately, traditional forms of soliciting public input often do not generate productive community engagement in historically underserved communities, and establishing trust through new community organizations can take years (Few et al. 2007; Klenk et al. 2017). The Climate Adaptation Solutions Accelerator (CASA) through School-Community Hubs project identifies the 10,008 public and charter schools serving kindergarten through Grade 12 students in California as promising sites for building community engagement and capacity for climate adaptation. Effective climate adaptation has to be grounded in an understanding of local vulnerabilities to climate hazards. To serve as community hubs for climate adaptation planning and activities, schools need information about the intersecting threats that climate change poses, including wildfire, heat, flooding, and other hazards.
In the project, MEDS students generated one final and three intermediate deliverables:

Final Deliverable: 

- An interactive dashboard summarizing local climate hazards, including both historical data and future projections. Moreover, in addition to geospatial and temporal data on single climate hazards, the web application will visualize aggregate climate hazards for each school. A user guide will be included, and additional information on adaptation measures may be included as a secondary reach goal. 

Intermediate Deliverables:

- A catalog of the technical specifications of relevant California climate hazard data, as well as California school boundary layers
- A summary literature review of approaches for compounding climate hazard data
- Development of a hazard summary metric and visual representation of compounding climate hazards at the school district level.

The interactive dashboard will be used by teachers, administrators, students, and community members to learn about climate hazards their school districts face. Results of the proposed project will contribute to a pilot project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), CRISES: Climate Adaptation Solutions Accelerator (CASA) through School-Community Hub.

#### Usage

This organization is split into two repositories:

1. [Climate Hazards](https://github.com/CASAschools/climate_hazards): Detailed composition on the data prepping and analysis of the climate hazards and hazard summary metric.
2. [Interactive Dashboard](https://github.com/CASAschools/shiny_dashboard): Code for development and deployment of Shiny Dashboard
