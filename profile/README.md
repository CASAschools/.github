# Climate Hazards Data Integration and Visualization for the Climate Adaptation Solutions Accelerator (CASA) through School-Community Hubs

The CASAschools Github Organization was created to host code to be submitted with partial satisfaction of the [Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS)](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) Capstone Degree requirements for the [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, University of California, Santa Barbara](https://bren.ucsb.edu/)

CASAschools team consists of: 

Faculty Advisor: Dr. Simone Pulver

Client: Dr. Sarah Anderson & Dr. Danielle Harlow

Students: [Liane Chen](https://github.com/lchenhub), [Charlie Curtin](https://github.com/charliecurtin1), [Kristina Glass](https://github.com/kristinaglass), and [Hazel Vaquero](https://github.com/hazelvaq).

## Project Summary

Community engagement in planning is essential for effective and just climate adaptation. Unfortunately, traditional forms of soliciting public input often do not generate productive community engagement in historically underserved communities, and establishing trust through new community organizations can take years (Few et al. 2007; Klenk et al. 2017). The Climate Adaptation Solutions Accelerator (CASA) through School-Community Hubs project identifies the 10,000 public schools serving kindergarten through Grade 12 students in California as promising sites for building community engagement and capacity for climate adaptation. Effective climate adaptation has to be grounded in an understanding of local vulnerabilities to climate hazards. To serve as community hubs for climate adaptation planning and activities, schools need information about the intersecting threats that climate change poses, including wildfire, heat, flooding, and other hazards
In the project, MEDS students will generate one final and three intermediate deliverables:

Final Deliverable: 

- An interactive dashboard summarizing local climate hazards, including both historical data and future projections at school district levels. 

Intermediate Deliverables:

- A catalog of the technical specifications of relevant California climate hazard data, as well as California school, school district, and socio-demographic boundary layers
- A summary literature review of approaches for compounding climate hazard data
- Development of an aggregated hazard risk and visual representation of compounding climate hazards and social vulnerability at the school district level.

The interactive dashboard will be used by teachers, faculty, students, and community members to learn about climate hazards their school districts face. Results of the proposed project will contribute to a pilot project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), CRISES: Climate Adaptation Solutions Accelerator (CASA) through School-Community Hub.
